    """
    Calculate the position, velocity, and acceleration of one object at a several times.

    This function borrows heavily from Brandon Rhode's
    `jplephem <https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/python-jplephem>`_ package,
    specifically the jplephem.spk.SPK._compute method. However, this version is written
    for JAX, not numpy. lax.scan is used instead of a for loop, jnp.where is used
    instead of if statements, etc. Also, in addition to position and velocity, you can
    also compute acceleration by differentiating the Cheybshev polynomials again. The
    input parameters are usually derived from the construct_perturbers.py module.

    Parameters:
        init (float):
            The initial time of the ephemeris in seconds since J2000 TDB
        intlen (float):
            The length of the interval covered by each piecewise chunk of the ephemeris in
            seconds. For DE44x, planets, this is 16 days, and for asteroids, it's 32 days.
        coefficients (jnp.ndarray(shape=(N, 3, M))):
            The Chebyshev coefficients describing the ephemeris
            For each of the M equal length piecewise steps, there are N coefficients for
            each of the 3 {x,y,z} dimensions. For the planets in the DE44x series,
            N=14 (high order terms zero-padded in some cases),
            and for asteroids, N=8.
        tdb: jnp.ndarray(shape=(R,))
            The times at which to evaluate the ephemeris in TDB JD
        velocity (bool):
            Whether to calculate the velocity of the planet
        acceleration (bool):
            Whether to calculate the acceleration of the planet. N.B. these values
            will be nonsense if velocity=False.

    Returns:
        Tuple[jnp.ndarray(shape=(R,)), jnp.ndarray(shape=(R,)), jnp.ndarray(shape=(R,))]:
            The position, velocity, and acceleration of the planet at the requested times.
            The full tuple is returned, but the velocity and/or acceleration will be 0s if
            velocity=False and acceleration=False. The full tuple is always returned
            to help give jax.jit fewer reasons to trigger compilations.
            Units are AU, AU/day, AU/day^2

    Notes:
        The Chebyshev polynomials are evaluated using the `Clenshaw algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clenshaw_algorithm>`_.
        An implementation exists in scipy/numpy, but not in jax as of 0.4.8

    Calculate the position, velocity, and acceleration of several objects at a several times.

    This is a thin wrapper around planet_state_helper, which is the actual function that does
    the computation from the ephemeris. Uses jax.vmap to vectorize the computation over
    multiple objects at once; as a consequence, each object's ephemeris info needs to
    have the same shape. This is why jorbit.construct_perturbers.construct_perturbers
    zero pads some higher order terms in the Chebyshev polynomials and/or repeats
    piecewise chunks of certain objects.

    Parameters:
        planet_params (Tuple(jnp.ndarray(shape=(N,)), jnp.ndarray(shape=(N,)), jnp.ndarray(shape=(N, M, 3, R)))):
            The initial times, interval lengths, and Chebyshev coefficients for N objects.
            The Chebyshev coefficients are of shape (N, M, 3, R), where M is the number of
            piecewise chunks, 3 is the {x,y,z} dimensions, and R is the number of
            coefficients in each chunk.
        times (jnp.ndarray(shape=(P,))):

        velocity (bool):, default=False
            Whether to calculate the velocity of the objects at each time. Must be True if
            acceleration=True
        acceleration (bool):, default=False
            Whether to calculate the acceleration of the objects at each time. N.B.
            these values will be nonsense if velocity=False.

    Returns:
        Tuple[jnp.ndarray(shape=(N, P, 3)), jnp.ndarray(shape=(N, P, 3)), jnp.ndarray(shape=(N, P, 3))]:
            The positions, velocities, and accelerations of the N objects at the P
            requested times. The full tuple is always returned, but the velocity and/or
