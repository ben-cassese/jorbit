            substeps and T times as the planet_xs.
        planet_gms (jnp.ndarray(shape=(M,))):
            The GM values of M planets in AU^3/day^2
        asteroid_gms (jnp.ndarray(shape=(P,))):
            Same as the planet_gms, but for P asteroids.
        C (jnp.ndarry):
            The coefficients for the mid-step position updates. These are pre-computed
            for 4th, 6th, and 8th order integrators and saved in jorbit.data.constants
        D (jnp.ndarray):
            The coefficients for the mid-step velocity updates. Similar to the C
            coefficients.

    Returns:
        Tuple[jnp.ndarray(shape=(T, N, 3)), jnp.ndarray(shape=(T, N, 3))]:
        xs: The positions of the N particles at T times. Units are in AU.
        vs: The velocities of the N particles at T times. Units are in AU/day.

    Examples:

        Two particles, central massive:
